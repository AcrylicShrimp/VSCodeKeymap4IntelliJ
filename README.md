# VSCodeKeymap4IntelliJ

This repository was forked from [bulenkov/VSCodeKeymap4IntelliJ](https://github.com/bulenkov/VSCodeKeymap4IntelliJ) to fix below bugs :

- Cannot type <kbd>tab</kbd>.
- Cannot indent or unindent selected lines (by press <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>).
- Keymap not working after restart the IDE (IDE not responds to any keys).
